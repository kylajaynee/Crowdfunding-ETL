# Crowdfunding-ETL
Module 8 Bootcamp
#### Project Overview
>In this Challenge, you’ll use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, you’ll extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. You'll then do the load phase. Specifically, you’ll use the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, you’ll upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table.  
#### Deliverables
  1. Extract Data
  2. Transform and Clean Data
  3. ERD and Table Schema, Load Data
  ####Outcome 
  With our new data sets we can more easily visualize and search for specific infomation about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects.
